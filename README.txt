ScheduleTron5000

What It Does:
User interface for creating, viewing, and saving schedules for team members in a company.
It has team member availability and requestsoffs baked into it so there's less disputes
with team members.

React for frontend because its one of the best and easiest to read frameworks/libraries.
Flask for backend. Anything will do for backend but learning Flask/Python is really easy.

There was a lot of trouble working on the main scheduling page. Implementing the draggable's
will managing screensize and whatever period of time being scheduled for was pretty tough.

Its not done yet though not far from being done.

Since this is not completed its moreso in testing mode.

So open frontend and backend separately in command prompt (using 2 command prompts).
You'll need node and flask installed on your computer to run. Once done run npm install
in the frontend which will install all dependencies. Next npm start to start the server.

Next in backend type 'flask run' to start the backend server.

It should be good to go by then
